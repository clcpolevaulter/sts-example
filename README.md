# sts-example

This repo demonstrates an issue that occurs with the sts client when it call the metadata server using Jest.

## Steps to reproduce

On an AWS EC2 with docker installed run:
``` bash
docker run -w /workspace -v $(pwd):/workspace  node:12-alpine npm run test
```

Result:

```
> sts-example@1.0.0 test /workspace
> npm ci && jest --testEnvironment=node --testTimeout=60000

added 580 packages in 7.106s
  console.log

      at Object.<anonymous> (test/sample.spec.js:10:17)

Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed.

This usually means that there are asynchronous operations that weren't stopped in your tests. Consider running Jest with `--detectOpenHandles` to troubleshoot this issue.
